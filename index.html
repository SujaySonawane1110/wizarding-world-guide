            <h2>Spell of the Day</h2>
            <h1 class="incantation">Wingardium Leviosa</h1>
            <div class="spell-text">
                <p><strong>The Levitation Charm</strong> is one of the first spells learnt by young witches and wizards. It allows the caster to make objects fly or levitate for a limited period of time.</p>
                <h3>🪄 Casting Instruction</h3>
                <p>The charm requires the "Swish and Flick" wrist movement. As Professor Flitwick famously instructed: <em>"And saying the magic words properly is very important, too—never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest."</em></p>

                <h3>📜 Etymology</h3>
                <p>The incantation comes from a mix of English and Latin. "Wing" (English for fly), "Arduus" (Latin for high), and "Levare" (Latin for lift). Literally, it means "lift up high."</p>

                <h3>⚡ Famous Uses</h3>
                <p>In 1991, Ronald Weasley used this charm to defeat a Mountain Troll in the girls' bathroom, levitating the troll's own club and dropping it on its head to save Hermione Granger.</p>
